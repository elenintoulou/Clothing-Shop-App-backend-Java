# Clothing-Shop-App-backend-Java
A simple Java console app for managing clothes using layered architecture

- Some methods are not currently used â€” I left them in place to work on them in the future.  
- No exception handling is implemented yet.  
- I plan to revisit and improve the code in the future!!!

Some features I have in this app are the following:
- Add clothing items 
- View all clothes 
- Find clothes by category 
- Check which clothes are out of stock 
- Update the price of any item 
- Delete clothing by name

 Note
All data is stored in memory (no database or file yet). Intended for practice purposes only!!!
