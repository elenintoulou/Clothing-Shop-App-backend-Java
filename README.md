# 👗 Clothing-Shop-App-backend-Java 👗

A simple Java console app for managing clothes using layered architecture

---

### Features
- ➕ Add clothing items  
- 👀 View all clothes  
- 🔍 Find clothes by category  
- 📉 Check which clothes are out of stock  
- 💰 Update the price of any item  
- ❌ Delete clothing by name  

---

### Notes
- Some methods are currently unused — I left them in place for future development  
- No exception handling is implemented yet  
- All data is stored **in memory** (no database or file persistence)  
- This app was built strictly for **practice purposes**

---

### What’s Next
I plan to revisit and improve the code, clean up the unused methods and possibly connect the app to a database for data persistence.
